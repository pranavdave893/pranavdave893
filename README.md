### Hey, [Pranav Dave]("http://pranavdave.me") ✌

I work as a Software Engineer at [ClearCare Inc](https://www.clearcareonline.com/). I am based in San Francisco, CA.

Since 2017 I am working with Python and Django. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently my team is working on building microservices by decoupling legacy monolithic design, implementing it in AWS Dynamo DB, AWS Lambda, AWS Kineses and Elasticsearch. <br /><br />
Building microservices with Distributed System and developing new services with <a href="https://dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/" target="_blank">Domain Driven Design</a> and <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html" target="_blank">Event Driven Design</a> pattern.
